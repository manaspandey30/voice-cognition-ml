# Voice-Based Cognitive Decline Pattern Detection
## Final Report

### Executive Summary

This project implements a proof-of-concept pipeline for detecting patterns in voice data that might indicate early cognitive decline. The system extracts and analyzes various audio features and speech patterns that have been linked to cognitive impairment in research literature. We demonstrate an unsupervised machine learning approach that can identify anomalous speech patterns without requiring labeled training data.

### Methodology

#### 1. Audio Data Processing

The system processes voice recordings through several stages:

1. **Audio Loading and Normalization**: We convert audio files to a consistent format (16kHz, mono) and normalize the amplitude.

2. **Feature Extraction**: From each audio file, we extract numerous features that may indicate cognitive decline:
   - **Silence Ratio**: Proportion of silence in speech (indicates pauses)
   - **Silence Count**: Number of silence segments (frequency of pauses)
   - **Zero Crossing Rate**: Rate of sign changes (relates to speech clarity)
   - **Energy Variation**: Changes in amplitude that may indicate hesitations
   - **Spectral Features**: Including centroid, bandwidth, and rolloff
   - **MFCCs**: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for voice characteristics

3. **Text Transcription**: For recordings with actual speech (not synthetic), we convert speech to text using Google Speech Recognition.

4. **Text Analysis**: We analyze transcribed text for:
   - Hesitation markers (uh, um, etc.)
   - Pauses per sentence
   - Speech rate
   - Word count and complexity

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning Approach

Rather than using supervised classification (which would require labeled data), we employed two complementary unsupervised approaches:

1. **K-means Clustering**: We group audio samples into clusters based on similarity of features. This helps identify natural groupings that might correspond to different cognitive states.

2. **Anomaly Detection via Z-scores**: We calculate standardized z-scores across all features to identify samples that deviate significantly from the norm. These outliers may represent cognitive decline indicators.

This approach allows us to detect unusual patterns without requiring a priori knowledge of what constitutes "normal" vs. "impaired" speech.

### Results and Insights

#### Most Insightful Features

Our analysis indicates that the following features are most valuable for detecting potential cognitive decline:

1. **Silence Ratio and Count**: The amount and frequency of pauses showed strong correlation with cognitive status in our synthetic data. Excessive pausing is a known indicator of word-finding difficulties.

2. **Energy Variation**: Fluctuations in speech energy helped identify hesitations and false starts, which can indicate cognitive processing difficulties.

3. **Spectral Features**: Changes in voice spectral characteristics showed promise for identifying subtle changes in voice production.

#### Visualizations

The system generates several visualizations to aid interpretation:

1. **Distribution of Anomaly Scores**: Shows the range and clustering of anomaly scores across samples.

2. **Silence vs. Energy Changes**: Plots the relationship between silence patterns and energy fluctuations, color-coded by cognitive level or cluster.

3. **Feature Correlations**: Heat map showing relationships between key features.

4. **Anomaly Scores by Cognitive Level**: For validation data, compares anomaly scores across known cognitive levels.

#### Risk Scoring System

We developed a risk scoring system that:

1. Calculates a composite anomaly score from multiple features
2. Categorizes scores into risk levels (low, moderate, high, very high)
3. Provides explainable results by showing which features contributed most to the score

### Next Steps for Clinical Robustness

To make this system clinically viable, several enhancements would be needed:

1. **Clinical Validation**: Collaborate with neurologists to validate features and thresholds using data from patients with confirmed diagnoses.

2. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Implement capabilities to track changes over time, as cognitive decline is progressive.

3. **Feature Refinement**:
   - Implement more sophisticated linguistic analysis for word substitution detection
   - Add semantic coherence measures
   - Include prosodic feature analysis (rhythm, stress, intonation)

4. **Validation Against Standard Tests**: Correlate results with established cognitive assessments (e.g., MMSE, MoCA).

5. **Demographic Adjustment**: Account for age, education, and language background in the baseline models.

### Technical Implementation

The implementation consists of three main components:

1. **Core Feature Extraction Module**: Processes audio files and extracts relevant features
2. **Analysis Module**: Applies unsupervised learning techniques to detect patterns
3. **API Endpoint**: Provides a standardized interface for scoring new audio samples

The system is designed to be:
- Modular and extensible
- Compatible with various audio formats
- Deployable as a standalone application or API service

### Conclusion

Voice analysis shows significant promise for non-invasive, early detection of cognitive decline patterns. This proof-of-concept demonstrates feasibility and provides a foundation for more comprehensive clinical validation. The unsupervised approach allows for detection of anomalous patterns without extensive labeled training data, which is particularly valuable in early-stage research.

With further refinement and clinical validation, this approach could contribute to earlier intervention in cognitive decline conditions, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely treatment and support.
